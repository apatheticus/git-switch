Create a high-fidelity GUI mockup of a Windows desktop app called “Git-Switch” for switching Git/GitHub user profiles. Ultra-futuristic, high-tech aesthetic, dark theme with electric cyan + azure accents, subtle neon glow, glassmorphism panels, GPU-accelerated look, crisp typography.

Canvas: 16:9, 1920x1080, centered app window sized ~900x600 with Windows title bar (minimize, maximize, close). Style: sleek cyber-minimal dashboard UI, clean grid, sharp alignment, soft blur glass panels, subtle gradients, minimal borders, luminous focus rings.

Layout requirements:
- Header section: left app logo + title “GIT-SWITCH”; right shows status pill “ONLINE” with green dot; center area shows ACTIVE PROFILE card with username, email, organization, and compact indicators: SSH connected, GPG ready, Scope: GLOBAL.
- Left sidebar (200px): nav items with icons and labels: Profiles (selected), Repositories, Settings, Import/Export. Selected item glows cyan and has a vertical neon indicator.
- Main content area: “YOUR PROFILES” section with 3 profile cards:
  1) “Acme Corporation” marked ACTIVE (cyan glow), shows email, shows SSH ✔ and GPG ✔, last used time, and buttons: APPLY GLOBAL, APPLY LOCAL.
  2) “Personal Account” inactive, shows email, shows SSH ✔ and GPG disabled, button SWITCH.
  3) “Freelance Client” inactive, shows email, shows SSH ✔ and GPG ✔, button SWITCH.
- Footer status bar: left: “SSH: CONNECTED” (green dot); middle: “GPG: READY” (green dot); right: “LOCK” button with padlock icon.

Typography:
- Primary UI font: modern sans like Inter / Segoe UI Variable
- Data fields and IDs: monospace like JetBrains Mono

Color + effects:
- Background near-black blue (#0B0F14), panels (#121A23) with glass blur, primary accent electric cyan (#00E5FF), secondary azure (#1A8CFF), success neon green (#00FF9C), warnings amber, errors red.
- Subtle glow on interactive elements, hover states implied, soft shadows, luminous dividers, micro-details like tiny circuit-line patterns in the background (very subtle).

Do not include any real company branding except the text “GIT-SWITCH” and the UI labels. No extra windows. No mobile UI. Make it look like a polished product screenshot ready for a PRD / pitch deck.
